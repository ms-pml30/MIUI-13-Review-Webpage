<title>MIUI 13.0.1 Review</title>
<body>
<body style="background-color:orange;">
<p><b>Appearance</b></p>
<p>In the 13th version of the MIUI operating system for Xiaomi smartphones, developers have added many new useful functions and other things, but, in my opinion, the main feature was the design, the update of which I personally have been waiting for a very long time.</p>

<p>New wallpapers have been added to this firmware (they haven't added live wallpapers yet, but the Xiaomi guys have tried so hard, so we won't blame them for this), widgets that now give more information and work more smoothly, and a notification curtain, adding a multimedia volume graph there. As you can see, MIUI is becoming more and more similar to IOS, but I think this is a plus, since IOS is a very beautiful operating system.</p>
<p><b>Optimization</b></p>
<p>In this section, programmers have improved accessibility features for the following applications: Phone, Clock and Weather. Also, according to them, "nodes in Thought Maps are now even more convenient and understandable." This is all good, of course, but I didn't notice any changes.</p>

<p><b>System</b></p>
<p>As usual, the security system has been improved, and, as usual, this update has not left any traces. The most important system change was the addition of Android 12 to the database, but, unfortunately, nothing but the number 2 instead of 1, this, as far as I understood, does not give.</p>

<p><b>Result</b></p>
<p>As for me, this is the most sensible update over the past year. Thanks to Xiaomi for this long-awaited work! I warn you in advance that some functions may not work on some device models. Thank you for reading the article! Goodbye!</p>
